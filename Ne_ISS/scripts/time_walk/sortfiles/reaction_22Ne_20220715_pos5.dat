# Below are the default parameters that can be changed by uncommenting
# and passing this file to iss_sort during the histogramming stage.
#
# This file is not required to run iss_sort, but if you want meaningfull
# physics histograms at the end, then you should change the parameters
# here to match your experiment. One can have multiple versions of this
# file to sort different runs or apply different recoil gates, etc.


## Reaction definition
BeamA: 22		# mass number
BeamZ: 10	# atomic number
BeamE: 9780.	# the laboratory beam energy in keV/u (note, not the usual MeV/u)
TargetA: 2		#
TargetZ: 1		#  
EjectileA: 1	# in (d,p) the ejectile is the proton
EjectileZ: 1	# we keep this language even though we have inverse kinematics
RecoilA: 23	# the recoil is the heavy ion
RecoilZ: 10	# not the target-like product as in normal kinematics


## Magnetic field settings
Mfield: 2.1		# Magnetic field strength in Tesla 


## Detector and target geometry
ArrayDistance: -90.05	# Target to array distance in mm (edge of first wafer; negative upstream; positive downstream)
ArrayDeadlayer: 0.0003	# Dead layer on surface of the array silicon in mm of Si equivalent
TargetThickness: 0.196	# Target thickness in mg/cm^2
#TargetOffset.X: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the vertical in mm (positive is up wrt beam direction)
#TargetOffset.Y: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the horizontal in mm (positive is right wrt beam direction)


# EBIS windows
EBIS_On: 1.48e6		# slow extraction is about 1.2 ms
EBIS_Off: 2.52e7		# Off window is 20 times the On window
